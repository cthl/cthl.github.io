      <h2>Teaching (CAAM 520 - Computational Science II)</h2>

      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
        Lectures are Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 1pm (location TBA).
        Office hours are by appointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the <a href=https://drc.rice.edu>Rice Disability Resource Center</a> and to meet with me to discuss accommodations.
      </p>

      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
        Familiarity with C or C++, basic knowledge of Unix/Linux command line tools, Git, and GDB. Key features of C and GDB will be revisited in class.
      </p>
      <p>
        All code and examples will be in C99, but students may use C++ in their submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students will required to create a <b>private</b> repository on GitHub for homework submissions (free for students, see <a href=https://education.github.com/benefits>here</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        I highly recommend using a virtual machine (VM) for the homework, as the course requires software that students may find difficult to install, especially on MacOS and Windows (GCC, GDB, Valgrind, MPI, PETSc, HPCToolkit). A Linux-based VM with all required software will be provided. It can be used with <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org>VirtualBox</a> on all major operating systems and requires about 10 GB of free disk space.
      </p>
