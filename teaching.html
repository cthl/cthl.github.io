      <h3 id=sec_prerequisites>Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
        Familiarity with C, basic knowledge of Unix/Linux command line tools and Git. Key features of C will be revisited in class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students will required to create a <b>private</b> repository on GitHub for homework submissions (free for students, see <a href=https://education.github.com/benefits>here</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        I highly recommend using a virtual machine (VM) for the homework, as the course requires software that students may find difficult to install, especially on MacOS and Windows (GCC, GDB, Valgrind, MPI, PETSc). A Linux-based VM with all required software is available <a href=https://rice.box.com/s/1fsjlvmved24ffkwujcw5m450eovpyqq>here</a>. It can be used with <a href=https://www.virtualbox.org>VirtualBox</a> on all major operating systems and requires about 5 GB of free disk space.

      <h3 id=sec_reading>Recommended reading and reference manuals</h3>
      <p>
        Slides and code examples presented in class are available <a href=https://github.com/cthl/caam520>here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This course is based on the following texts, which are recommended, but not required:
        <ul>
          <li><i>Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers</i> by Hager and Wellein (2011)</li>
          <li><i>The C Programming Language (2nd ed.)</i> by Kernighan and Ritchie (1988)</li>
        </ul>
        Additionally, students may want to consult the following reference manuals:
        <ul>
          <li><a href=https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-3.1/mpi31-report.pdf>MPI: A Message-Passing Interface Standard - Version 3.1</a></li>
          <li><a href=https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/OpenMP-API-Specification-5.0.pdf>OpenMP Application Programming Interface</a></li>
          <li><a href=https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb>Debugging with GDB</a></li>
          <li><a href=http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/valgrind_manual.pdf>Valgrind manual</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 id=sec_homework>Homework</h3>
      <p>
        Students are encouraged to discuss the homework and to work together, except on pledged problems. However, each student is expected to implement solutions and write reports individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        Submissions must include a Makefile that can be used to compile any submitted code. Submitted code must be written in C or C++ (any standard supported by GCC). If C++ is used, please ensure that
        <ol>
          <li>Makefiles are adjusted accordingly, e.g., use <tt>g++ -std=c++11</tt> instead of <tt>gcc -std=c99</tt>, and</li>
          <li>
            the C++ code does not violate any interfaces specified in the homework problems. For example, if the task is to implement a function
            <p align=center><tt>double norm2(const double *vector, int size)</tt></p>
            you may implement that function in C++, but you may not change its signature to something like
            <p align=center><tt>double norm2(const std::vector&lt;double&gt; vector)</tt>.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
