      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>
        I am interested in iterative solvers and preconditioners for large, sparse linear systems of equations that arise in the discretization of partial differential equations.
        Specifically, I am interested in multigrid methods that can be applied when geometric coarsening is challenging or impossible, i.e., in flow simulations in complex pore-scale rock geometries.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is centered around the development, implementation, and performance evaluation of p-multigrid methods, their combination with other multigrid methods and iterative solvers, and their application to pore-scale flow simulations for hydrocarbon recovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        My other interest include numerical methods for partial differential equations (mostly elliptic and parabolic PDEs) and the applications of mathematics in oil and gas exploration and production.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am also interested in the application of software engineering techniques in the design and development of scientific software.
      </p>

      <h3>CPHIS</h3>

      <p>
        I implemented several p-multigrid methods in a software package called CPHIS, which is available as open source software <a href="https://github.com/cthl/CPHIS">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        CPHIS can be used as a stand-alone linear solver or as a hybrid parallel (MPI+OpenMP) solver with <a href="https://trilinos.github.io/tpetra.html">Trilinos' Tpetra package</a>.
        CPHIS' modular design allows for the easy integration of other linear algebra and solver frameworks, such as <a href="https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/">PETSc</a>, <a href="https://trilinos.github.io/muelu.html">MueLu</a>, or <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/amgx">AMGX</a>, with little coding effort.
