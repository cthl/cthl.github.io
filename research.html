      <p>
        I am interested in iterative solvers and preconditioners for large, sparse linear systems of equations that arise in the discretization of partial differential equations.
        Specifically, I am interested in multigrid methods that can be applied when geometric coarsening is challenging or impossible, i.e., in flow simulations in complex pore-scale rock geometries.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is centered around the development, implementation, and performance evaluation of p-multigrid methods, their combination with other multigrid methods and iterative solvers, and their application to pore-scale flow simulations for hydrocarbon recovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        My other interest include numerical methods for partial differential equations (mostly elliptic and parabolic PDEs) and the applications of mathematics in oil and gas exploration and production.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am also interested in the application of software engineering techniques in the design and development of scientific software.
